# bashToCrystal
Bash to Crystal is an attempt on parser which takes Bash shell script, and output crystal programs, however due to how much they differ is expected that the programmer will have to do lots of refactoring on the program.

Although it's called bashToCrystal, a lot of the code it's independent, so modifying it to accept or output another language should be somewhat easy (at much there would be the need to improve the core).
